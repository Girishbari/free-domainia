      <td>Containerization : </td>
      <td> Understanding the concept and purpose of containerization.Grasping the functionality and usage of Docker for encapsulating applications and dependencies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Image Management:</td>
      <td>Probably I worked for this part mostly such a pipeline was the backbone of this project, I was too confused and wanted to leave project for once however, I slowly worked of making a streamlined flow of generating build files (docker helped) and then getting images deployed on S3 or cloudfare (I ended using both) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Using promises</td>
      <td>I have only heard and learned about promises and never utilized them in my any of the project until now, oh man they were life saver, they helped me in making and flow better and workable, I literally now want to use promises everywhere, I really got the understand of promises, async await, .then and catch</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <td> AWS Services: </td>
        <td>Familiarizing oneself with ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for secure Docker image storage. Understanding ECS (Elastic Container Service) and its role in orchestrating
          containerized applications. Exploring EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for scalable computing resources.
